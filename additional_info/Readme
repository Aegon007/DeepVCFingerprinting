Our research findings about voice command fingerprinting on smart speakers will be published by The 13th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec 2020). 

This folder includes additional information that may not be included in the original paper due to space limitation. 

You can find the list of 100 voice commands we used in the closed-world setting of Amazon Echo dataset.  

You can find the list of 100 voice commands we used in the open-world setting of Amazon Echo dataset. 

You can find the structures of neural networks we used in our evaluation. 

You can find the tuned hyperparameters for neural networks. 

You can find the parameters we used in adaptive padding in the defense.  

You can find some pictures of our data collection tool (designed by Sean Kennedy). 

You can find a picture of GPU machines we used in our lab for the data anlysis in this study (2 Titans and 1 1070). 

You can find two short videos when the data collection tool was running automatically. The links of the two videos can be found below:
