# DeepVCFingerprinting

This repository contains the source code and data for the Voice Command Fingerprinting Attack using Deep Learning.  The attack is a privacy leakage attack that allows a passive adversary to infer the activity of a smart speaker user by eavesdropping encrypted traffic between the smart speaker and the smart speaker's cloud services.

**The dataset and code are for research purposes only**. The results of this study are published in the following paper:
